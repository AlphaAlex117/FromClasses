CheckPoint1:

// For an ordinary letter up to 3.5 ounces, the cost is .47 plus .21 for each additional ounce (or part of an ounce). Try some examples:

//    A letter that is 1 ounce (or less) is just .47.
//    For a 3 ounce letter the cost is .47 + (2 * .21) = .89
//    For a 2.3 ounce letter, the cost is also .47 + (2 * .21) = .89, since 1.3 rounds up to 2
//    For a 3.1 ounce letter the cost is .47 + (3 * .21) = 1.10, since 2.1 rounds up to 3 
//	  For a 3.5 ounce letter would cost .47 + (3 * .21) = 1.10, using the first rule
//    For a 3.8 ounce letter would cost .94 + (3 * .21) = 1.57
//    For a 10 ounce letter would cost .94 + (9 * .21) = 2.83 
    
Flowchart1: It would give you the correct price.
Flowchart2: The second flowchart doesn't need a nested if-statement because it will
			everything else is greater than one, therefore, the greater than 3.5 statement 
			will never run.
Flowchart3: It would give you the correct price.
